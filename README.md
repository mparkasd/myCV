# A simple resume template and theme for Front-End Developer.

## Overview

I tried to create my personal CV from scratch using only HTML and CSS in this project. The objective was to get rid of the watermarks that were added from CV template websites and then be able to print them as a PDF. The decision to select said technologies was taken because the CV template was simple. Refreshing my HTML and CSS skills was also part of that decision.

## Usage

You can customise the CV template by changing the parameters in white color in the HTML file:


#### Name 
![Changing the name](/assets/name.jpg)

#### Contact Info
![Changing the contact info](/assets/contactInfo.jpg)

#### Education Info
![Changing the education info](/assets/educationInfo.jpg)

#### Languages and the respective %

If you have any feedback or suggestions for things I can add please let me know by by raising an [issue](https://github.com/mparkasd/myCV/issues), I'll be happy to help.

Thank you for checking out my resume theme / template.
