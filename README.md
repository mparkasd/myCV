# A simple resume template and theme for Front-End Developer.

## Overview

I tried to create my personal CV from scratch using only HTML and CSS in this project. The objective was to get rid of the watermarks that were added from CV template websites and then be able to print them as a PDF. The decision to select said technologies was taken because the CV template was simple. Refreshing my HTML and CSS skills was also part of that decision.

## Usage

You can customise the CV template by changing the parameters in white color in the HTML file.

Here are some examples
---
#### Name

#### Education Info

#### Languages and the respective *width* %
